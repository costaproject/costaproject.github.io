    <h1>COSTA</h1>
    <p>
      COSTA is a new project to build community-driven software cyberinfrastructure for physical intelligence.
      The project is led by researchers at Vanderbilt University, Georgia Tech, UC Davis, and Stanford University.
      The primary aim of COSTA is to make it easy for Computer and Information Science and Engineering professionals (e.g., AI and robotics researchers) to integrate state-of-the-art, high-performance, fully-differentiable physical simulation capabilities into their research or production workflows.
      As the project develops, this website will contain information about the software platform itself, as well as community events and resources related to COSTA.
      We also expect to publish curricular resources to help educators integrate COSTA into the classroom.  Stay tuned!
